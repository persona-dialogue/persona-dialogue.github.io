                    Extensive research on LLM-based spoken dialogue systems has significantly advanced the development of intelligent voice assistants. However, the integration of role information within speech remains an underexplored area, limiting its application in real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-party dialogue settings. With the growing demand for personalization, voice assistants that can recognize and remember users establish a deeper connection with them. We focus on enabling LLMs with speaker-awareness capabilities and enhancing their understanding of character settings through synthetic data to generate contextually appropriate responses. We introduce Persona-Dialogue, the first large-scale multi-party spoken dialogue dataset that incorporates speaker profiles. Based on this dataset, we propose PAChat, an architecture that simultaneously models both linguistic content and speaker features, allowing LLMs to map character settings to speaker identities in speech. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PAChat successfully achieves speaker-specific responses, character understanding, and the generation of targeted replies in multi-party dialogue scenarios, surpassing existing spoken dialogue systems.	    </div>

								I had a golden retriever when I was younger—gentle and smart. I don’t have a pet now, but feeding the swans in the park feels just as comforting. Emily, since you love sports, maybe consider an active breed, like a border collie.

								I think cats are more independent, which works well for busy families, but dogs are more affectionate and interact more with kids. Paul is right—pets really do bring a sense of companionship.

								Emily, you might consider an energetic, easy-to-care-for medium-sized dog, like a border collie or a labrador. They love exercise and would fit your lifestyle. As Linda said, pets bring joy and warmth to life. I hope you find the perfect companion soon!
